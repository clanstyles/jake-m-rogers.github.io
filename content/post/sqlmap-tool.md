Over at Designing for Privacy they've come up with a fantastic new way of raising data protection issues in the design process.

They've come up with a set of flash cards which are split into four categories (constraints / regulation / system / users) which can be used to conceptualize the legal, moral and ethical responsibilities of parties during the design process.

To take a look head on over to [www.designingforprivacy.co.uk](http://www.designingforprivacy.co.uk) where you can also find the downloadable versions to print.
